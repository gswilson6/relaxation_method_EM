***RELAXATION METHODS FOR ELECTROSTATICS***

(this README is easier to view in full screen for formatting)

PURPOSE: 
This code will calculate the electric potential of 4 unique geometries in 2 dimensions, and a point charge in 3 dimensions,
as well as the electric fields of each of these geometries respectively. The data produced by this code
can then be analyzed in a language like Mathematica to achieve physical descriptions for the results.


RUNNING THE CODE:
In order to run this code the user first need to make sure they are
in the correct directory where they stored this program. 

Once the user is in the correct directory they can then proceed to type:

	make relax

into the command line of the terminal. This will compile the code for the user. 

Now the user can run the code by entering:

	./relax

into the command line. The user will then be prompted for specific inputs:
	
	1st user input : Dimension of Matrix 
		**************enter only real positive even integers from 10 to 1000****************
		
		******because the 3 dimensional array reads in a the beginning of the code
	        	      if you enter in larger than 63 then the program will give a segmentation fault***
	

	2nd user input: Desired Relaxation Method to be used 
		******enter only 1, 2, 3, or 4 other inputs will result in an error******* 

	
	3rd user input : Desired geometry of system to be used
		******enter only 1, 2, 3, or 4 other inputs will result in an error******* 

PRINTOUT:
The code will print out the electric potential to a file called laplace.txt in an array of numbers (1 element per row).
The code will also print out the electric field components in the x and y directions (2 elements per row).
In the terminal window the user will also be able to see how many iterations the code took to run in order to reach convergence,
as well as how long (in seconds) the code took to run.

GENERATE FIGURES:
If you have access to Mathematica, when reading in the data for the electric potential you can simply input:

	SetDirectory["address of data file laplace.txt"]
	data = Partition[ReadList["laplace.txt", Number], 20];

	picture1 = ListContourPlot[data, ContourLabels -> Automatic, 
  	PlotLegends -> BarLegend[{"Rainbow", {0, 100}}]]

	Export["picture1.pdf", picture1]

To plot the electric field lines you can simply input:

	SetDirectory["address of data file efield.txt"]
	data1 = ReadList["efield.txt", {Number, Number, Number, Number}];

	Show[ListVectorPlot[data1]]

These methods will give you a plot for both the electric potential and electric field if you are using Mathematica.
